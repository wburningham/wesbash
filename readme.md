##wesbash

This is my personal version of the [bash it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it) commands and scripts. The biggest change is the smaller colors file so a new prompt loads faster.

##Installation
Link the bash profile to your user directory:

	ln -s ~/.wesbash/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
